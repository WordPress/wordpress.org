					<p>There are hundreds of thousands of web hosts out there, the vast majority of which meet the <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/">WordPress minimum requirements</a>, and choosing one from the crowd can be a chore. Just like flowers need the right environment to grow, WordPress works best when it&#8217;s in a rich hosting environment.</p>

					<p>We&#8217;ve dealt with more hosts than you can imagine; in our opinion, the hosts below represent some of the best and brightest of the hosting world. If you do decide to go with one of the hosts below and click through from this page, some will donate a portion of your fee back&#8212;so you can have a great host and support WordPress.org at the same time. If you&#8217;d like to try WordPress for free, you can get started with a free website or blog at <a href="https://wordpress.com/wordpress-free/">WordPress.com</a>.</p>

					<h2>Host Feedback</h2>

					<p>We&#8217;re committed to helping create a wholesome and hassle-free WordPress hosting environment. If you feel there are issues with one of
						the hosts listed here, please send a note to hosting dash feedback at this domain. If the situation warrants we&#8217;ll work with you and
						your host on a solution.
					</p>

					<p>Note before contacting us: Please don&#8217;t send us legal takedown orders or threats, we don&#8217;t actually host every WordPress blog in the world.
						If you don&#8217;t understand that, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be sending legal notices anyway.
					</p>

					<h2>Be Listed on This Page</h2>

					<p>We&#8217;ll be looking at this list several times a year, so keep an eye out for us re-opening the survey for hosts to submit themselves for inclusion.
						Listing is completely arbitrary, but includes criteria like: contributions to WordPress.org, size of customer base, ease of WP auto-install and auto-upgrades, avoiding GPL violations, design, tone, historical perception, using the correct logo, capitalizing WordPress correctly, not blaming us if you have a security issue, and up-to-date system software.
