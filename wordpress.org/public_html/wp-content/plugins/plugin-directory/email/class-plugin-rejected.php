Plugins are rejected after three months (90 days) when there has not been significant progress made on the review.

Please wait for that email before requesting further details.

If you\'re still working on your code, don\'t panic. You can reply to the original review (or even this email) with your updated code for as long as needed. Even years. All we ask is you do not resubmit your plugin until asked to do so.',
