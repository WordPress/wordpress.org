**Slug / Permalink**

Based on your display name of ###NAME### your plugin has been initially assigned the following permalink:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/###SLUG###/ _(please note: This URL will not be operational until your plugin review is approved)_

You can customize this on the [Plugin Submission page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/add/), if you were unable to do this, please reply with the details of what you would like your plugin slug to be.
Once your plugin is approved, _we cannot change it_. If the slug listed [on the submission page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/add/) is incorrect, please tell us as soon as possible; if that's correct, you do not need to contact us.
Your plugin slug / permalink is subject to change once a human review is completed.

**Review Process**

Our volunteer team of reviewers endeavors to perform all reviews in a timely manner, we are unable to provide an exact date of when your plugin will be reviewed.

We encourage all plugin authors to use [Plugin Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/) to ensure that most basic issues are resolved first.
Please note: Automated tools may have false positives, or may miss issues. Plugin Check and other tools cannot guarantee our reviewers wonâ€™t find an issue that requires fixing or clarification.

Please refer to the [Plugin Submission page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/add/) for:

* Up-to-date details of the currently review queue length and estimated times.
* Upload a new version of the plugin: In case you wish to update the files of your plugin submission before we begin with the review.

**Guidelines**

All plugins are required to abide by our Plugin Guidelines. Please ensure you have read and understand these.
https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/

A common issue encountered by plugin authors is that we require your accounts email address to remain operational, not to have autoresponders, and not mark our emails as spam.
To reduce the possibility of this affecting you, please ensure you add `plugins@wordpress.org` to your address book / contact list.
If you use an email forwarder, alias, or group mailing list, please ensure that address is added to the Allow list.
