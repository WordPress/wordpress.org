Browse Happy
===========

Browse Happy is site that identifies the latest versions of modern web browsers in an effort to raise the awareness of the options available. Its goal is to promote use of the most up-to-date browsers for their better security, support, features, performance, and implementation of web standards.

This repository is the theme used for the site [Browse Happy](http://browsehappy.com). The site is powered by [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) and as such this is just a standard (if specific and custom) WordPress theme.

The official repository is actually located at [https://meta.svn.wordpress.org/sites/trunk/browsehappy.com/](https://meta.svn.wordpress.org/sites/trunk/browsehappy.com/), with an [associated component](https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&component=browsehappy.com&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&order=priority) on the Meta Trac system for bug reports.

That said, the Git repository is an active peer to the meta.svn repository and all changes (ideally) would be committed here first (and if not, synced back over ASAP).
